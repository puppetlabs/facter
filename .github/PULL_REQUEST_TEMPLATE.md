PLEASE LABEL YOUR PULL REQUEST ACCORDINGLY!

Choose only one of the following:

"backwards-incompatible" - use this label for PRs that breaks some old functionality

"feature" - use this label for new added functionality

"bugfix" - use this label for PRs that contain fixes

"maintenance" - use this label for PRs that contain trivial changes (eg. changes in unit tests)

Also please add "community" additional label if you're part of puppet community (special attention will be provided for those PRs).
