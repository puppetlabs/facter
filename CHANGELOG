    Fixes #1334 - Forced Facter to use LANG=C

    Fixes #1357 - Change ps syntax for OSX and BSD

    Set the timeout on the AIX kernelrelease fact to 5 seconds.

    Refactored so each fact resolution can specify a separate timeout,
    but the default is still 0.5.

    Refactered ipmess.rb and util/ip.rb to support separate *BSD logic for
    *BSD aliased interfaces.

    Updated dmidecode facts fixing ticket #60

    Added AIX support for some facts

    Add lsbmajdistrelease fact for CentOS and Red Hat

    Updated Red Hat spec file for new version
    The 'facter' executable now has an option (-p|--puppet) for loading the
    Puppet libraries, which gives it access to Puppet's facts.

    Added autoloading to Facter with a default of not loading all facts,
    which results in a significant speedup when only one fact is sought.
    Facts are autoloaded in either a single file named after the fact or
    in any file in a directory named after the fact.

    Significantly refactored Facter's internals, including creating tests
    for all internal classes.

    A netmask fact has been added closing ticket #46.  It only returns the
    netmask of the primary interface (in the same behaviour as the ipaddress
    and macaddress facts).

    Facts to return multiple interfaces on a host have also been updated.
    If you have multiple interfaces on Linux, *BSD, or Solaris/SunOS you will
    now get facts for each interface's IP address, MAC address and netmask.
    The facts will be structured like:
      ipaddress_int = 10.0.0.x
      macaddress_int = xx:xx:xx:xx
      netmask_int = 255.255.255.0

    Facter now identifies Ubuntu hosts and their releases using the
    operatingsystem and operatingsystemrelease facts.

    The Debian operatingsystemrelease fact now correctly returns the current
    Debian release.

    Fixed ticket #48 - ioperatingsystem and operatingsystemrelease for CentOS

    Fixed ticket #44 and allowed support for Xen multiple interfaces and aliased
    interfaces.  Supports both Linux and *BSD.

    Added interfaces fact to add as index for ip/MAC address facts

    Added Mandrake support for operatingsystem fact - closed ticket #47

    Fixed ticket #45

    Added netmask.rb closing ticket #46

1.3.8:
    Fixed Rdoc::usage bug on CentOS 5 - closed Puppet #753 and Facter #40

    Added support to return multiple interfaces and their IP addresses and
    MAC addressess as facts. Returns interface_interfacename and
    macaddress_interfacename.  Existing ipaddress and macaddress facts are
    unchanged and still returned.  Currently Linux only.  Closes #6.

    Added macaddress fact support for FreeBSD and OpenBSD - closes #37

    Added hardwareisa support for *BSD platforms - closed #38

    Facter now detects the Mandriva distribution - closes #39

    Facter now correctly detects ipaddress on NetBSD - closes #42

1.3.7:
    A couple of small bugfixes, including fixing Facter.flush so it correctly
    flushes cached values, and the mac address fact only returns one
    value, not all of them.

    Converted all of the fact names to symbols, rather than the somewhat
    random case used previously.  When the facts are converted to a hash,
    they still convert the fact name to a string.

1.3.6:
    A bugfix release, including fixes for #29, and #30.  Also fixed
    the SSH keys so they only have the key, not the type or description.

1.3.5:
    A bugfix release.

1.3.4:
    Added many new facts, including LSB facts.

    Fixed a few small bugs, notably the error you could get when asking
    for a non-existent fact.

1.3.3:
    Added thread exclusivity to memory and processor facts.

    Added the ability to retrieve facts by pulling them out of the shell
    environment.

1.3.2:
    Temporarily disabled memory and processor facts since they might cause hangs.

1.3.1:
    Fixed autoloading so that it catches any errors in loaded libraries.

1.3:
    Significant internal refactoring, such as replacing 'tag' with 'confine', and
    reusing 'tag' for semantic purposes.

    Made autoloading of facts better.

1.2.1:
    Fixed a "bug" that occurs if there's a file named "facter" in your
    ruby search path (as opposed to directory).

1.2.0:
    Added RubyVersion, FacterVersion, and PuppetVersion facts.

    Added autoload capabilities, so you can add facts without modifying
    the core library.

    Added the ability to retrieve facts by treating them as a method on the
    Facter class, e.g., Facter.operatingsystem.

    Added a to_hash method to Facter, which retrieves all facts as a hash.

1.1.4:
    Fixing installer bug.

1.1.3:
    Identifying CentOS correctly.

1.1.2:
    Added 'ldapname' attribute, so Facts can be easily converted to
    LDAP.

1.1.1:
    Fixed a bug that occurs when you ask for the value of an unregistered
    fact.

1.1.0:
    Added support for OpenBSD (and probably NetBSD and FreeBSD), and significantly
    refactored (heh) how facts and resolution mechanisms are added.

1.0.2:
    Added SuSE distro
    Added initial support for Cygwin, thanks to contributions from Eric Sorenson

1.0.1:
    Added 'id' fact, which basically returns 'whoami'.

1.0:
    Rewrote entirely.  It's much simpler to use, and now supports
    adding new fact resolution mechanisms at run-time.

1.0b1:
    Initial release.
