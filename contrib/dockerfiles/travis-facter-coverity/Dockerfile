# This Dockerfile uses Coverity, which requires a project and authentication token.
# Since it's based off the facter builder, we hard-code the project; the authentication
# token should remain secret, so it's required as an argument when starting the builder.
# Other optional arguments also exist to select a branch to build.
# Docker startup arguments (required if no default):
# - COV_NAME: coverity scan name
# - COV_USERID: coverity scan user id
# - COV_EMAIL: coverity scan e-mail
# - COV_TOKEN: the authentication token
# - COV_FORK: the github fork, defaults to puppetlabs
# - COV_BRANCH: the branch, defaults to master
# - COV_JOBS: number of parallel jobs to run for the build, defaults to 1
