A cross-platform Ruby library for retrieving facts from operating systems.
Supports multiple resolution mechanisms, any of which can be restricted to
working only on certain operating systems or environments. Facter is especially
useful for retrieving things like operating system names, IP addresses, MAC
addresses, and SSH keys.

It is easy to extend Facter to include your own [custom facts](custom.html) or
to include additional mechanisms for retrieving facts.
