# files to be packaged into a tarball and released with deb/rpm
files: '[A-Z]* exe ext lib man scripts vendor cmake'
# space separated list of files to *exclude* from the tarball
# note that each listing in files, above, is recursively copied into the tarball, so
# 'tar\_excludes' only needs to include any undesired subdirectories/files of the 'files'
# list to exclude
tar_excludes: 'ext/packaging'
# Array of templates or globs of templates to evaluate. Note that without this key, the packaging will
# default to searching for any files in `ext` with the extension '.erb' and evaluate them. When this
# key is supplied, its values override the defaults, and all desired erb files must be specified with a path or glob.
templates:
  - ext/redhat/facter.spec.erb
  - ext/debian/changelog.erb
