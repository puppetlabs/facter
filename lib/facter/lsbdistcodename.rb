# Fact: lsbdistcodename
#
# Purpose: Return Linux Standard Base information for the host.
#
# Resolution:
#   Uses the lsb_release system command
#
# Caveats:
#   Only works on Linux (and the kfreebsd derivative) systems.
#   Requires the lsb_release program, which may not be installed by default.
#   Also is as only as accurate as that program outputs.
