# Fact: lsbdistid
#
# Purpose: Return Linux Standard Base information for the host.
#
# Resolution:
#   Uses the `lsb_release` system command.
#
# Caveats:
#   Only works on Linux (and the kfreebsd derivative) systems.
#   Requires the `lsb_release` program, which may not be installed by default.
#   Is only as accurate as the output of `lsb_release`.
