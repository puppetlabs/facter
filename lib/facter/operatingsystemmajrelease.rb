# Fact: operatingsystemmajrelease
#
# Purpose: Returns the major release of the operating system.
#
# Resolution: splits down the operatingsystemrelease fact at decimal point for
#  osfamily RedHat derivatives and Debian.
#
# This should be the same as lsbmajdistrelease, but on minimal systems there
# are too many dependencies to use LSB
#
# List of operatingsystems at time of writing:
#"Alpine" "Amazon" "Archlinux" "Ascendos" "Bluewhite64" "CentOS" "CloudLinux" 
#"Debian" "Fedora" "Gentoo" "Mandrake" "Mandriva" "MeeGo" "OEL" "OpenSuSE" 
#"OracleLinux" "OVS" "PSBM" "RedHat" "Scientific" "Slackware" "Slamd64" "SLC"
#"SLED" "SLES" "SuSE" "Ubuntu" "VMWareESX"
