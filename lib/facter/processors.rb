# Fact: processors
#
# Purpose:
#   Provide additional facts about the machine's CPUs, including:
#   Models: A list of processors present on the system.
#   Count:  The number of hardware threads.
#   Physicalcount: The number of physical processors.
#   Speed: The speed of the processors on the system.
#
#   This fact is structured. These values are returned as a group of key-value pairs.
#
# Resolution:
#   Linux and kFreeBSD parse `/proc/cpuinfo` for each processor.
#   AIX parses the output of `lsdev` for its processor section.
#   Solaris parses the output of `kstat` for each processor.
#   OpenBSD uses the sysctl variables `hw.model` and `hw.ncpu` for the CPU model
#   and the CPU count respectively.
#   Darwin utilizes the system profiler to collect the physical CPU count and speed.
#
# Caveats:
#   The 'speed' sub-fact is not currently supported on all platforms.
