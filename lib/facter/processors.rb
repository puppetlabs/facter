# Fact: processors
#
#
#  Purpose:
#     Additional facts about the machine's CPU's, including
#     processor lists, models, counts, and speeds.
#
#  Resolution:
#     Each kernel utilizes its own implementation object to collect
#     processor data. Linux and kFreeBSD parse `/proc/cpuinfo` for each
#     processor. AIX parses the output of `lsdev` for its processor section.
#     For Solaris, we parse the output of `kstat` for each processor. OpenBSD uses
#     the sysctl variables 'hw.model' and 'hw.ncpu' for the CPU model and the
#     CPU count respectively. Darwin utilizes the system profiler to collect
#     the physical CPU count and speed.
