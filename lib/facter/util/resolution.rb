# implementation of a fact. A single fact can have many resolutions and
# the correct resolution will be chosen at runtime. Each time
# {Facter.add} is called, a new resolution is created and added to the
# set of resolutions for the fact named in the call.  Each resolution
# has a {#has_weight weight}, which defines its priority over other
# resolutions, and a set of {#confine _confinements_}, which defines the
# conditions under which it will be chosen. All confinements must be
# satisfied for a fact to be considered _suitable_.
