This system supports ZFS pool feature flags.

The following features are supported:

FEAT DESCRIPTION
-------------------------------------------------------------
async_destroy                         (read-only compatible)
     Destroy filesystems asynchronously.
empty_bpobj                           (read-only compatible)
     Snapshots use less space.
lz4_compress                         
     LZ4 compression algorithm support.
multi_vdev_crash_dump                
     Crash dumps to multiple vdev pools.
spacemap_histogram                    (read-only compatible)
     Spacemaps maintain space histograms.
enabled_txg                           (read-only compatible)
     Record txg at which a feature is enabled
hole_birth                           
     Retain hole birth txg for more precise zfs send
extensible_dataset                   
     Enhanced dataset functionality, used by other features.
embedded_data                        
     Blocks which compress very well use even less space.
bookmarks                             (read-only compatible)
     "zfs bookmark" command
filesystem_limits                     (read-only compatible)
     Filesystem and snapshot limits.
large_blocks                         
     Support for blocks larger than 128KB.
large_dnode                          
     Variable on-disk size of dnodes.
sha512                               
     SHA-512/256 hash algorithm.
skein                                
     Skein hash algorithm.
device_removal                       
     Top-level vdevs can be removed, reducing logical pool size.
obsolete_counts                       (read-only compatible)
     Reduce memory used by removed devices when their blocks are freed or remapped.
zpool_checkpoint                      (read-only compatible)
     Pool state can be checkpointed, allowing rewind later.
spacemap_v2                           (read-only compatible)
     Space maps representing large segments are more efficient.
